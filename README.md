### Quick Start

#### Important Notes
- You may need to downgrade node to version 10x in order to install grunt without any issues. [Use nvm for this](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
- If you are using an ARM based macbook (M1), you will need to run these commands in [rosetta mode](https://osxdaily.com/2020/11/18/how-run-homebrew-x86-terminal-apple-silicon-mac/).

1. `npm install -g grunt-cli` to install the Grunt CLI
2. `npm install grunt --save-dev` to install Grunt in the scope of this project
3. `npm install`
